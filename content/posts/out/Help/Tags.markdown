title: Tags
date: 2013-08-03
Zim supports the use of tags to organize pages. Tags are keywords or labels that are used to categorize pages.

Tags can be used anywhere in a page using the "@" prefix. Like this: @example @tags

To find context based on tags you can use the [Search](./Searching.markdown) dialog. For example to find all pages tagged with "@example" you can search for "``Tag: example``" or just for "``@example``". Since tags are cached in the index, this search is much quicker than a full text search for random words.

There is also a plugin that will add a tag cloud and a page index organized by tag in the side page, see also [Plugins:Tags](../Plugins/Tags.markdown)
