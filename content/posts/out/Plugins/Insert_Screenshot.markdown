title: Insert Screenshot
date: 2013-08-03
This plugin adds a dialog that allows you to take a screenshot of the desktop or of a particular window and directly insert the image into the current zim page.

**Dependencies:** This plugin requires the "scrot" application to be installed. In specific the "scrot" command should be available in the system path.

On maemo devices "screenshot-tool" will be used as an alternative.
