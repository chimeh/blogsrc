title: Print to Browser
date: 2013-08-03
This plugin provides a workaround for the lack of printing support in zim. It exports the current page
to html and opens a browser. Assuming the browser does have printing support this will get your data to the printer in two steps.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.
