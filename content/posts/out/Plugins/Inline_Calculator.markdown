This plugin allows you to evaluate simple mathematical expressions in zim.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.

**See also:** the [Arithmetic plugin](./Arithmetic.markdown) which does something similar

Examples
--------
Simple expressions can be evaluated on a single line:

3 + 3 = 	

When you press "Tools" -> "Evaluate Math" the result of the expression is automatically added behind the "=" sign. Note that the cursor needs to be behind the expression you want to evaluate.
If there is text on the same line before the expression it should end with an ":". For example:

Fuel: 30 + 27.5 =

Other words in front of the formula can result in errors.

Apart from single line expressions you can also do multi-line summations and subtractions.  The syntax for this is like this:

7
3
5
--- +

In this case the cursor needs to be below the summation when you trigger the evaluation.
