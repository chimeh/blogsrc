title: Log events with Zeitgeist
date: 2013-08-03
When this plugin is activated, information about accessing, creating and modifying Zim Wiki pages is logged using the Zeitgeist framework. This allows applications like the Unity Dash to display recently used pages or the Activity Journal to give a timeline overview of your activities.

**Dependencies:** This plugin requires the Python bindings for Zeitgeist. For Debian and Ubuntu, these bindings are available in the ``python-zeitgeist`` package.
